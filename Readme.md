# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm glad you're here to explore what I've built. This website is a reflection of my skills, projects, and achievements as a developer. My goal with this project was to create an engaging, visually appealing, and user-friendly platform that highlights my strengths in web development, while showcasing my attention to detail and professional design approach.

## Design Choices

- **Minimalistic Layout:** I chose a clean, straightforward design with well-organized sections to ensure easy navigation and readability. I believe that simplicity enhances the user experience.
- **Color Palette:** I selected a modern, calming color scheme with contrasting call-to-action elements to create a balance of professionalism and warmth, which I hope feels inviting and functional.
- **Typography:** The fonts I used are not only legible but also trendy, ensuring the website feels fresh while being easy to read across devices.
- **Responsiveness:** One of the things I focused on was making sure the website looks great on all screen sizes. I used CSS Flexbox and media queries to ensure the layout adjusts smoothly.

My portfolio includes the following key sections:
1. **Introduction:** This section provides an overview of who I am and my career journey as a developer, highlighting what drives me.
